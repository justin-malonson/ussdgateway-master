Name
	ussd set maxmapv

SYNOPSIS
	ussd set maxmapv <version-number>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to set the value for MAP Application Context version. The 
	version number set here will be used for USSD messages exchanged. 
	Mobicents USSD Gateway supports version negotiation.  So if you set this to a
	higher version (say for example version 2, however your network only understands 
	version 1), the ussd Gateway will automatically do the version negotiation and 
	exchange V1 messages when V2 exchange fails. However this causes additional 
	messages to be exchanged and increases the overall load on the system. 
	Therefore it is advisable to always set the correct version.

EXAMPLES
	ussd set maxmapv 3

	The above command will set the value for the parameter 'version-number' to 
	'3'and the terminal will display the message 
	"Parameter has been successfully set". 

	You can verify this by issuing the 'ussd get maxmapv' command.

	ussd get maxmapv
	maxmapv = 3
