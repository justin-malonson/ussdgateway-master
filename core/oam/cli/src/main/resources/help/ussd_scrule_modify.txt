Name
	ussd scrule modify

SYNOPSIS
	ussd scrule modify <short-code> <url> <flag> <protocol> <network-id>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to modify existing routing rule for a short code for 
	PULL case only. This is not applicable for PUSH case.
	A short code and networkId pair is used as a unique routing rule identifier.

	Standard Parameters
	
	short-code        - USSD short code which when dialed by user and received 
                        by USSD Gw, will forward request to configured URL
                        
    url               - If rule is configured as HTTP, this should be the URL
                        where HTTP POST with XML payload should be forwarded to.
                        If rule is configured as SIP, INVITE will be sent to this 
                        ip:port

    Optional Parameters
    
    flag              - flag is either true or false, default is true. If true that 
                        means this is exact match. If false, that means the dialed 
                        short-code begins with configured short-code. For example 
                        if you created below rule, and user dials *123*7776543*223#, 
                        it will match the rule and request will be forwarded to the 
                        URL http://myip:8080/mobiussd/recharge
                        
                        ussd scrule create *123* http://myip:8080/mobiussd/recharge false
                        
    protocol          - USSD Gateway supports 2 protocols - HTTP and SIP (3GPP Specification 
                        24.390). If not specified default is HTTP. If protocol is HTTP, gateway
                        will forward request as HTTP POST. If its SIP, INVITE will be sent 
                        SIP Client.  
                        
    networkid         - USSD Gateway can be connected to multiple operators/network at same time
                        and each operator exposing same or different short-code. Each operator 
                        (jSS7 stack configured) has its unique networkid assigned and incoming
                        request can be matched with configured networkid here. Only if short-code 
                        and networkid match's, request is forwarded to corresponding url. Default
                        value is 0.                                                
	                                             
		

EXAMPLES
    ussd scrule modify *519# http://localhost:8080/ussddemo/test

    Above rule will update the routing rule for the short code *519# and networkId 0
    for HTTP url http://localhost:8080/ussddemo/test and the matching flag "false".

    ussd scrule modify *916* http://localhost:8080/ussddemo/test2 true HTTP 2	

    Above rule will update the routing rule for the short code *916* and networkId 2
    for HTTP url http://localhost:8080/ussddemo/test2 and the matching flag "true".

    ussd scrule modify *123* 127.0.0.1:5065 true SIP

    Above rule will update the routing rule for the short code *123* and networkId 0
    for SIP destination 127.0.0.1:5065 and the matching flag "true".

    ussd scrule modify *321# 127.0.0.1:5066 SIP 4

    Above rule will update the routing rule for the short code *321# and networkId 4
    for SIP destination 127.0.0.1:5066 and the matching flag "false".
