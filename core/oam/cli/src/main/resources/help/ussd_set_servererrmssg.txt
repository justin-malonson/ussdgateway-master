Name
	ussd set servererrmssg

SYNOPSIS
	ussd set servererrmssg <message>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to set the message to be displayed to the end user when there
	is an error in the USSD Gateway. For example if the application server
	responds to the Gateway's request with a NOT OK (200) response or with an OK 
	response but the XML Payload is corrupt, then the USSD Gateway will kill the 
	session and send a Server error message to be displayed to the end user specified 
	by the value of this paramter 'servererrmssg'. 

EXAMPLES
	ussd set servererrmssg Server error, please try again after sometime

	The above command will set the value for the parameter 'servererrmssg' to "Server 
	error, please try again after sometime" and the terminal will display the message 
	"Parameter has been successfully set". You can verify this by issuing the 
	'ussd get' command whose output will be as below:

	ussd get

	noroutingruleconfigerrmssg = Not valid short code. Please dial valid short code
	dialogtimeouterrmssg = Request timedout please try again after sometime
	dialogtimeout = 25000
	servererrmssg = Server error, please try again after sometime
