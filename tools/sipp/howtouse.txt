This folder contains scripts for testing of SIP connector if USSD GW.
For testing you need:
1) download and install SIPP library from: http://sipp.sourceforge.net/
2) copy there *.xml files with SIP scripts into the folder where you have installed SIPP library
3) you can run test cases with commands like:
sipp 127.0.0.1:5060 -sf serv_notify.xml -m 1 -i 127.0.0.1
options:
- 127.0.0.1:5060 : IP address and port at USSD GW side
- -sf serv_notify.xml : specify a name of a scenario file
- -m 1 : specify a number of SIP calls (a simple case - only one SIP request)
- -i 127.0.0.1 : host IP address of the host with SIP library

Scenarios examples:
a) PULL case
- clt_resp.xml: return ProcessUnstructuredSSRequest response
- clt_ussdreq_resp.xml: after ProcessUnstructuredSSRequest script sends UnstructuredSSRequest and then after a mobile station response sends ProcessUnstructuredSSRequest response 

b) PUSH case
- serv_notify.xml: sends UnstructuredSSNotifyRequest and after a mobile station response it will close dialog
- serv_unstrreq.xml: sends UnstructuredSSRequest, a mobile station response, sends one more UnstructuredSSRequest, a mobile station response, close dialog  

Possibly not all SIP tags are properly set in these scripts. These scripts contains a minimal tags set for for testing of SIP message flow.
