	<title>Multi-tenancy support</title>

	<para>&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; is able to work in multi-tenant mode by connecting to a set of different SS7 operators.
	The procedure is based on dividing of USSD routing rules into several areas ("subnetworks").
	</para>
	<para>
Each area has its unique digital "netwokId" value. You can assign a unique USSD Global Title for each netwokId. Each SS7 SCCP service access point (SAP) and each 
USSD Routing Rule belongs to one of the networks (to each of them a networkId value is assigned). Default netwokId value is "0". If a user does not specify a netwokId value when USSD Routing Rule or SAP rule creation, networkId=0 will be assigned.
	</para>
	<para>
When a PULL request comes from SS7 network, a networkId value from SAP will be assigned to a USSD dialog.
Then USSD Routing Rule with assigned networkId will be chosen for request routing to a proper HTTP or SIP application.
	</para>
	<para>
When a PUSH request comes from HTTP application, a networkId value from HTTP XML payload ("networkId" attribute) 
is taken (or is assigned as 0 if "networkId" attribute is missed in the XML payload).
Then SS7 SAP will be chosen when routing USSD request to SS7 network.
	</para>
	<para>
When a PUSH request comes from SIP application, a networkId value is always assigned as 0. It is impossible now to use SIP App originated messages for multi-tenancy.
