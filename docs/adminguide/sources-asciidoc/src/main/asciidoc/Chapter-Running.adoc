== Running the Gateway

=== Running the Gateway (JBOSS 5)

.Procedure: Run {this-platform} {this-application} 
. Pre-requisite: 
+
* You must have {this-platform} {this-application} installed as explained in the Installation Guide.
* If you are using the SS7 board on server, you must ensure that the `java.library.path` variable is set to point to the directory containing the native component.
  Alternatively you can copy it to the JBoss native library path manually.

. All you have to do to start the Gateway is start the JBoss Application Server.
  To start the JBoss Server you must execute the [path]_run.sh_ (Unix) or [path]_run.bat_ (Microsoft Windows) startup script in the installation directory [path]_{this-folder}-ussdgateway/jboss-5.1.0.GA/bin_.
  Note that this will start the server in the default profile.
  The "default" profile is a clean profile where you start from scratch and configure the entire SS7 Stack and USSD Gateway to suit your requirements. 
+
. Result: If the service started properly you should see the following last few output lines in the Unix terminal or Command Prompt depending on your environment:

[[_running_the_gateway_simulator]]
== Running the Gateway - Simulator Profile

The {this-platform} {this-application} offers you an option to run the Gateway with a "simulator" profile for testing purpose.
The "simulator" profile is a pre-configured profile to work with the jss7-simulator.


=== Running the Gateway - Simulator Profile (JBOSS 5)

Starting the Gateway with the "simulator" profile is similar to the steps explained for the "default" profile except that you must pass the string value "simulator" to the -c command line option when invoking the run script.
 
----

[bin]$ ./run.sh -c simulator
----            

By default, the USSD Simulator profile is configured for use in Linux systems.
For using it in Microsoft Windows systems, you must configure the parameters as explained below. 

Open the file  [path]_{this-folder}-ussdgateway-<version>/jboss-5.1.0.GA/server/simulator/data/SCTPManagement_sctp.xml_ and replace in two places, the parameter `ipChannelType="0"` with `ipChannelType="1"` to enable TCP connection instead of SCTP since Windows does not support SCTP.
If you are using in a Linux system, there is no modification required to the settings. 


=== Running the Gateway - Simulator Profile (Wildfly)

Starting the Gateway with the "simulator" profile is similar to the steps explained for the "default" profile except that you must add `jboss.server.base.dir` command with the string value "simulator" to the command line option when invoking the run script.
 
----

[bin]$ ./standalone.sh -Djboss.server.base.dir=$JBOSS_HOME/simulator
----            

By default, the USSD Simulator profile is configured for use in Linux systems.
For using it in Microsoft Windows systems, you must configure the parameters as explained below. 

Open the file  [path]_{this-folder}-ussdgateway-<version>/wildfly-10.1.0.Final/simulator/data/SCTPManagement_sctp.xml_ and replace in two places, the parameter `ipChannelType="0"` with `ipChannelType="1"` to enable TCP connection instead of SCTP since Windows does not support SCTP.
If you are using in a Linux system, there is no modification required to the settings. 


[[_simulator_ussd_example]]
=== Running USSD Examples in Simulator

If you are not familiar with the {this-platform} jss7 Simulator, you can find instructions about using the jss7-simulator in the {this-platform} jSS7 User Guide.
You will also find example test cases explained in detail in the jSS7 User Guide.
In this section you will find a sample USSD Pull and USSD Push examples explained using the jSS7 Simulator. 

.Procedure: Running {this-platform} jSS7 Simulator - USSD Pull Example
. Change the working directory to the bin folder in the Simulator's installation directory. 
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
[vinu@vinu-neha ~]$ cd {this-folder}-ussd-<version>/tools/{this-platform}-ss7-simulator/bin
----			
+
. Ensure that the [path]_run.sh_ start script is executable. 
+
----
bin$ chmod +x run.sh
----					 
+
. Execute the [path]_run.sh_ Bourne shell script with the command `./run.sh gui`.
+ 
----
bin$ ./run.sh gui
----
+
  This will launch the Simulator GUI Application. 
+
. When the GUI shows up, select "main" (default) as host name [or type "win" as host name under Windows] and press the 'Start' button.
  The Simulator is already pre-configured to connect to the USSD Gateway (running in simulator profile). Press 'Run test' and again click on 'Start' in the next screen.
  The Simulator will connect to USSD (via m3ua protocol). The Low level part is configured to SCTP (not TCP) protocol and hence you can test the USSD in a Linux environment.
  To test under Windows OS, you must change the SS7 simulator settings to TCP.
+
. After approximately 30 seconds you will see the state of the Simulator change to "M3UA connection is active" as in figure below:  
+
.USSD SS7 Simulator - Active
image::images/USSD_SS7_Simulator_ACTIVE.png[]						
+
. {this-platform} {this-application} is configured with a routing rule for *519#. Dial *519# in your Simulator GUI and press 'Send ProcessUnstructuredRequest'. The example will respond to you with the message "Hello World 1.
Balance 2.
Texts Remaining".  
+
.USSD SS7 Simulator - Process Unstructured Request
image::images/USSD_SS7_Simulator_Process_Unst_request.png[]						
+
. Now Dial 1 in your Simulator GUI and press 'Send UnstructuredResponse'. You should get a response "Thank you!".  
+
.USSD SS7 Simulator - Unstructured Request
image::images/USSD_SS7_Simulator_Unstruc_request.png[]						

.Procedure: Running {this-platform} USSD Simulator (HLR) - USSD Push Example
. You must first start the {this-platform} {this-application} in simulator profile.
+
. To send a PUSH request go to http://localhost:8080/jmx-console/ and click the link `org.mobicents.ussdgateway.example` in the left menu.
  Then open the MBean `'name=HttpPush'`. 
. MBean provides two operations: 1) `sendNotify` to push Notification and 2) `sendRequest` to push USSD menu based tree.
  The parameter `Isdn` is the MSISDN to which Notify or Request is to be sent.
+
.{this-platform} USSD Simulator - Notify
image::images/Restcomm-ussd-simulator_Notify.png[]
+
You can simulate a simple Notify dialog by following the below steps: 
+
* Fill the ISDN field with a preferred ISDN number, for example "1111" is good for SS7 Simulator.
  Now press "Apply changes". 
* Perform "reset" operation. 
Perform "sendNotify" operation with parameters: String=<Text of your notification>, boolean=false, int=60000 and String=<any random string>. Parameters definition is as below  
+
* 1st String is USSD message that you want to push to mobile 
* 2nd Boolean if set to true means USSD Gw will send empty TCAP Begin and try to establish dialog before sending actual message. 
* 3rd Int is custom invoke timeout.
  User must respond within this period else USSD Gw will terminate Dialog and Application will get appropriate error message 
* 4th String is random string that is stored at USSD Gw side as custom object.
* When ever response comes back, USSD Gw will include this custom string in XML Payload. 
* Perform "close" operation. 
You will now find a notification at the SS7 Simulator. 
+
You can also simulate more complicated scenarios like pushing the tree based menu to user and expecting some input from users by calling `sendRequest`.
The below Class provides more explanation for attributes and operations of HttpPush.

[[_using_gui]]
== Running the Graphical User Interface

Open a Web Browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/{this-folder}-management/. This will launch the {this-platform} GUI Management Console which is horizontally segregated into multiple tabs, one tab for each product in the {this-platform} Suite.
You will notice that only the tabs of products whose binaries are installed already will be shown enabled and active in the GUI.
If you have successfully installed the {this-platform} {this-application} you will find the tabs for JAIN-SLEE, JMX, SS7 and USSD GW active and enabled.
For more details on using the GUI for SS7 or JAIN-SLEE please refer to their respective user guides.
This document only provides instructions for using the GUI to configure the USSD Gateway. 

Switch to the USSD GW tab and you will find that the window will look similar to the figure below.
The GUI is divided into three sections: 

* A left panel listing the management and monitoring units (Server Settings, Routing Rules, Metrics). You can click on any of these to select and navigate to the specific management unit.
* A main panel displaying the currently selected management unit. The main view is categorized into multiple tabs to manage different aspects of the selected layer.
* A bottom panel displaying the log data.
  You can clear the log anytime by clicking on the trash icon at the top right corner of this panel.
  You can also minimize or maximize this panel to suit your needs.
