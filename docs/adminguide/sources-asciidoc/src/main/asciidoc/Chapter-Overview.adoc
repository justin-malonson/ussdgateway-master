[[_ussd_overview]]
== USSD

USSD stands for Unstructured Supplementary Services Data which is a protocol used by GSM mobile phones much like the Short Message Service (SMS) but used to communicate with the service provider's  applications/services.
USSD is used by the service provider to offer the subscriber with operator services like prepaid callback service, location-based content services, menu-based information services,  mobile-money services and similar interactive services. 

There is a difference between USSD and SMS handling.
Unlike SMS, which makes use of a `store and forward` method of message delivery,  USSD messages establish a real-time connection during a USSD session.
In the case of SMS, Short Message is first delivered to the sender's Short Message Service Center (SMSc)  which then attempts to deliver the message to the intended recipient (s). So SMS does not guarantee that the message will be delivered instantly.
 

== USSD Session

USSD establishes a real time session between the mobile handset and the application handling the service and the information from the mobile handset is sent directly to the service.
The concept of a real time session is very useful for constructing an interactive menu driven application.
Refer to the figure below depicting the working of a real time session.

A user dialing an USSD service number (short code) initiates a dialog with the USSD handling application deployed on the {this-platform} Platform as shown in the above figure.
The "Network Node" in the figure could be a MSC, HLR or VLR.
The {this-platform} Platform integrates with the "Network Node" using the MAP protocol.
 

[[_ussd_shortcode]]
== USSD Service number

Short codes are special numbers (shorter than normal phone numbers) often associated with automated services and are unique to each operator.
A detailed description of the allowed MMIs (or short codes) which the user can dial is specified in `3GPP TS 22.090`.
In the user's home network the following number range is defined for USSD services:
*1, 2 or 3 digits from the set (*\* *, #) followed by 1X(Y), where X=any number 0-4, Y=any number 0-9, then, optionally "*\* *" followed by any number of any characters, and concluding with # SEND*

For example a user may dial *#122# to reach a specific USSD service which is deployed in the home network.
The application in its order may reply with a menu based on the dialed short code.
One of the biggest benefits is that this service is always available even when the user is roaming. 

== MAP Message Flow

The diagram below depicts a typical MAP message flow for data transfer between the "Network Node" and the {this-platform} platform to implement a menu driven application.
If you would like to read more about mobile-intiated (and network-initated) USSD operations and the use of MAP USSD services, please refer to [3GPPTS 24.090] in the references section. 


image::images/ussd-map.png[]

Mobile initiated USSD service begins when the user dials a USSD string (*#122# in this example). The message flow involves the following steps:  

. The Network sends a 'TCAP Begin' message with the Component 'MAP_PROCESS_UNSTRUCTURED_SS_REQUEST' to the {this-platform} platform.
  The {this-platform} platform invokes USSD application logic. 
. The Application requests additional information from the user (action one or action two) via 'MAP_UNSTRUCTURED_SS_REQUEST' encapsulated in a 'TCAP Continue' message.
  The 'TCAP Dialogue' starts now.
. The Application receives the user's selection of the action.
. Based on the user's menu selection, the application performs the predefined logic associated with the selection and sends a response back to the user.
  This time the application does not require additional information from the user and it sends a response using the component 'MAP_PROCESS_UNSTRUCTURED_SS_REQUEST' and terminates the 'TCAP dialogue'.

[[_ussd_gateway_desc]]
== USSD Gateway

Existing MSC, VLR, and HLR network elements are proprietary and run on non-standard operating environments located in trusted operator's zones that make it difficult to build and deploy new applications.
Also, these network elements do not provide the tools and interfaces needed to access and retrieve data from content providers over the Internet.
The USSD Gateway connects to the MSC, VLR, or HLR and enables the flow of USSD messages to be extended to an open, standards-based application server located in the IP network.
The AS also provides the tools and interfaces to enable access to the content providers through the Internet.

[[_mobicents_ussd_overview_http]]
=== HTTP Transfer Mechanism

The {this-platform} USSD Gateway makes use of HTTP protocol between the gateway and the third-party applications (or Value Added Service Modules). {this-platform} USSD Gateway receives the USSD request from the subscriber's handset/device via the GSM Signaling network and then translates these requests to HTTP depending on the rules configured in the Gateway to route to a corresponding Value Added Service (VAS) or third-party application. The HTTP callback mechanism allows the third-party Application to be agnostic to Operating System, Programming Language and Framework.
The third-party Application can be either of the following technologies on any Operating System: 

* Apache Tomcat, JBoss AS, Oracle Application Server, IBM Websphere etc for JSP/Servlet on Java 
* PHP
* Microsoft IIS for ASP
