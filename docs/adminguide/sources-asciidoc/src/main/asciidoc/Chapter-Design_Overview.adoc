{this-platform}  {this-application} is based on robust and proven {this-platform}  JAIN SLEE 1.1 Server and {this-platform}  jSS7 Stack. 

{this-platform}  JAIN SLEE Server is a highly scalable event-driven application server with a robust component model and fault tolerant execution environment.
It provides a set of connectors to a variety of networks elements: SS7 MAP, TCAP, INAP, ISUP, SMPP, XMPP, SIP, MGCP, HTTP, XDM, XCAP, Diameter and many others.
It is fully compliant with JSR 240 (JSLEE 1.1). 

{this-platform}  jSS7 is a software based implementation of the SS7 protocol.
It provides implementation for Level 2 and above in the SS7 protocol Stack. {this-platform}  jSS7 Stack User Guide is bundled within and you can refer to the guide for more details on the Stack. 

The diagram below depicts top design overview:

{this-platform}  {this-application} provides Load Balancing and Fault Tolerance.
Two or more third-party Application Servers can be paired to provide Fault-Tolerance on the Gateway and GSM Network level. 

Geographic Redundancy can be achieved as shown in the diagram below:

Below diagram shows how to achieve load-balancing by connecting to two STP's from Operator side.

[IMPORTANT]
====
As of now, the Gateway supports the following protocols for proxying: 

* HTTP
* SIP
